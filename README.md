# DistWebProject - Note Taking App

This Note Taking Application was built in order to fulfill the requirements for the Distributed Web Systems course at 
Georgia Southern University. Our goal was to create a web server where a user could create an account that would be 
used to store personalized notes and reminders specific to each user.
